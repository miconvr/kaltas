## Checks

```bash
node --check popup.js
node --check offers-loader.js
node scripts/validate-offers.js
```

## Contributing

Only add or update an offer after checking an official source, and keep the text generic so prices and promo codes don't go stale. Run `node scripts/validate-offers.js` before opening a pull request. Every offer change is reviewed before it is merged, and merging to `main` publishes it to users.

## Privacy

Kaltas compares the current tab hostname with local data after you open the popup. Theme and footer choices stay on your device. To keep offers current, the popup and toolbar badge fetch the public offers file from GitHub, so GitHub can see your IP address like any website; no browsing data is sent. Read the full [privacy policy](PRIVACY.md).

## Disclaimer

Kaltas is an independent, open-source student project. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to any other product, platform or organization with a similar name, including scholarship platforms. Product names, logos and trademarks in the offer list belong to their owners and do not imply endorsement.

## License

Open source under the [MIT License](LICENSE). Contributions are welcome, but offer data still needs an official source and human review before it is merged.
